Services: Growth is calculated based on "Service Units" (increasing from 85.2 to 185.7) and "Revenue per Service Unit".
Top-Line Result: Total revenue is projected to grow from $383,285 in FY 23 to $582,737 by FY 29.

**2. Profitability Trends**
The model tracks a steady increase in efficiency and bottom-line performance:
Net Income: Expected to rise from $96,995 in FY 23 to $166,501 in FY 29.
Profit Margin: The data indicates a rising profit margin trend, starting at 25% in FY 23, dipping slightly to 24% in FY 24, and then climbing consistently to reach 29% by FY 29.
